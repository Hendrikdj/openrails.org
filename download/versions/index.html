    <h2>Three Versions of Open Rails</h2>
    <p>
      Three versions of Open Rails are readily available to users, as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="3_versions.png" width=617>
    <p>
      For first-time users, we recommend the <a href="../program">Stable Version</a> which comes with an installer.
    </p>

    <h2>Updater</h2>
    <p>	
      Whichever version you choose, Open Rails has a mechanism to notify you of new versions and to update Open Rails for you.
      You will find the settings for this mechanism in <i>Menu > Options > Update</i>
    </p>
    <img src="updater_tab.png" width=617>
    <p>
      Open Rails will check for updates at most once a day.
      If an update is found, then you can install the update just by clicking on the link in the top, right corner:
    </p>

    <h2>Testing Version</h2>
    <p>	
      If you follow the Open Rails project on the forums, then you will hear about bug-fixes and new features.
      These are included in the Unstable Version for developers and testers to try out.
      Once they have been checked and approved, they are published (on Friday) as the latest Testing Version.
      Any user can easily update to the current weekly Testing Version and benefit from these improvements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: Multiple versions of Open Rails will not interfere if they are saved to different folders.
    </p>

    <h2>Unstable Version</h2>
    <p>
      To support development, the 
      <a href='http://james-ross.co.uk/projects/or?utm_campaign=unstable-version&utm_source=openrails.org&utm_medium=referral'>latest unstable version</a>
      is also available, which is updated as and when we make changes to it.
      Previous unstable versions <a href='http://james-ross.co.uk/projects/or/log?utm_campaign=unstable-version&utm_source=openrails.org&utm_medium=referral'>are available</a>. 
      The unstable versions are more <strong>likely to contain serious bugs</strong> 
      and are only recommended for users wishing to help with Open Rails development.
