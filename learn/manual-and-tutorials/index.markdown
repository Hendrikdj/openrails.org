        <h2>Manual</h2>
        <p>
            Each download includes a copy of the Operating Manual. For convenience, you can also directly <a href='{{ page.manual_path }}'>download the manual</a> ({{ page.manual_date | date: "%d %B %Y" }}).
        </p>
        <h2>Test Environment for Models</h2>
        <p>
One of our aims for Open Rails is that train performance should be as realistic as closely as possible. To help achieve this,
Peter Newell has developed <a href="http://www.coalstonewcastle.com.au/physics/">an environment for testing</a> the performance of locos and rolling stock. Do they perform as we expect?
</p><p>
It may be the model that is not configured correctly or, as Open Rails develops, it may be that the simulator is lacking in realism.
</p><p>
In either case, a neutral, repeatable test environment helps to pin down the issue and get it fixed.
